What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? - To be able to analyze a need and create a alogrithm and data structure based on the data and what is needed.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. - If you have the wrong kind of data structure then the algorithm will not process effeciently and could use memory and time that isnt needed.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? - When I was struggling with different algorithms I was able to google examples and I got a stronger understanding and a stronger code.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? - Algorithims are predomenantly used to automation and should be used with the appropriate data structure.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? - I am focusing on more algorithms and making everything more automated for less duplexity.
